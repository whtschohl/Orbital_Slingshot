# Orbital Slingshot
This was a student project in my second semester. 
I wanted to calculate the difference between when a rocket is launched from
  * earth to mars,
  * earth around the moon (using the moons gravity like a slingshot) to mars
  * launching from the moon to mars (assuming that we have found a way to create a space elevator to easily get things to the moon)
This idea was not a good one but it taught me a lot.
